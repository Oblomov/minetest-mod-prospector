Prospector mod
===========

This mod introduces the propsecting kit, which enables the minimap radar view
even in survival mode. The kit is built combining the mapping kit, binoculars,
and two prospecting lenses, assembled from 4 gold ingots, 4 diamond and 1 mese
crystal each. Recipes:

Lens:

GDG
DMD

Kit:

LBL

where L is the lens, B the binoculars, M the mapping kit.

When the prospecting kit is in the (main) inventory, the minimap can be enabled
with the appropriate key (cycling through both aerial and radar views),
and the user can use zoom view (with a FOV that is even smaller than
the one provided by the binoculars).
